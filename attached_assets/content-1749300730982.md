Utilising over a thousand terrestrial AIS stations worldwide, our AIS network adds a great value to people in the marine industry and help customers find the needed solution through our AIS vessel database. Enhanced with Voyage-related and Master data, Port Calls and much more information, the AIS API will get your business to the next level.

Our AIS API returns one or more of the following datasets depending on the queried method. Data response is in **JSON** (default) or **XML** format.
